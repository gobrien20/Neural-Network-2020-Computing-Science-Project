# Neural-Network-2020-Computing-Science-Project

This is my Adv Higher Computing Science Project 2020.

The program will be a neural network which trains on sample data to solve XOR and then takes the inputs from a webpage and to try to guess the correct output.  

I will use an insertion sort to order all the generations by the errors from smallest to highest to show the change over time and the best results. 

I will use object-oriented programming in my solution and the neural network will be made of various matrices, defined using 2D arrays. I will use arrays of objects to store the weights and the layers in the neural network. This will allow the calculations to be done more efficiently. 

The program will interface with a webpage to receive form inputs and to display formatted outputs of the current results and sorted results from previous tests.  

This program is intended to be used to see how a neural network learns over time, in order to better understand the process.
